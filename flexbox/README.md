**Flexbox Layout in CSS**

The CSS code provided in this document demonstrates the use of flexbox, a powerful layout model in CSS that simplifies the creation of flexible and responsive page layouts. Flexbox provides a way to distribute space and align items within a container along a single axis or multiple axes. This readme briefly explains how flexbox is utilized in the code to achieve certain layout features.

**Header Section:**

In the header section of the code, flexbox is employed to create a flexible header layout. The `.header-container` class is used to wrap the logo and navigation menu, and it's set as a flex container with the following properties:

- `display: flex;` - This makes the `.header-container` a flex container, enabling flexbox properties.
- `justify-content: space-between;` - This distributes available space between the logo and the navigation menu, pushing them to the outer edges of the container.
- `align-items: center;` - This centers the items vertically within the `.header-container`, aligning them along the cross-axis.

**Navbar Section:**

Flexbox is also applied to the navigation menu to create a horizontal row of navigation items. The `.nav` class represents the navigation menu and is set as a flex container with the following property:

- `display: flex;` - This transforms the `.nav` class into a flex container, allowing its child elements (navigation items) to be aligned along the main axis.

Additionally, the margin between consecutive navigation items is adjusted using the `.nav .nav-item + .nav-item` selector. The margin is set to `0 0 0 2rem`, creating spacing between adjacent navigation items.

**Services Section:**

The `section-services` class utilizes flexbox to achieve a responsive layout for the services section. The `.section-services` class wraps the content in a flex container and uses the `flex-wrap: wrap;` property to allow the services to wrap onto a new line if the container's width is insufficient.

**Latest News Section:**

Within the `section-latest-news` class, the `.row` class is reversed using the `flex-direction: row-reverse;` property. This reverses the order of the latest news articles, displaying them in reverse chronological order.

**Flexbox Simplifies Layout:**

Flexbox greatly simplifies layout design by providing a more intuitive way to control the alignment, distribution, and order of elements within a container. By utilizing flex properties, the code achieves responsive and flexible designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. Flexbox is an essential tool for modern web development, enabling efficient layout creation without complex CSS rules.
